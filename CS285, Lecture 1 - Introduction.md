# Part I

Let's say you wanna build a system to get a robot to pick up objects. 

Problem? See objects through camera --> Output Co-ordinates $(x, y, z)$.

Can't just localize where objects are in the picture and output position, much more complex problem than that --> Lot's of special cases and exceptions. Very hard. Eg. Weird shape object, weird center of mass, soft/deformable, etc.

Too many special cases --> Appealing to use ML.

Could just use a supervised learning algorithm for this. Problem!! Supervised learning needs data, need a LOT of data, very hard!! Even people can't solve this problem very easily through data, human intuition doesn't give good data for robo fingers.

What if we just run the robots to run trials??

This is *Reinforcement learning.*

Do --> Collect Data --> Improve policy

Recent advancements in AI? LLMs!! Drawings!! biology stuffs

What are you learning? --> The distribution of the data, where the data comes from is very important, if data comes from say, a bunch of images from the web, the kind of pictures on the web, the way people type on keyboards?

> move 37, interesting --> Weird move that humans wouldn't have made, but actually good move. Emergent behaviour.
